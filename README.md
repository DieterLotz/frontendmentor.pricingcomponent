## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Making a concerted effort to avoid over engineering the template portion
- Deeper understanding of CSS Selectors, pseudo classes and elements
- Deeper understanding of CSS Specificity 


### Continued development

- Better use of semantics in HTML
- Using CSS Selectors and specificity to replace JS
- Use of Grid as opposed to Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) - This site is perfect for anyone wanting to understand selectors in depth which helped me a lot.
- [Flexbox Cheat Sheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Flexbox can be tricky, especially when figuring out which axis the *align-items* and *justify-content* are targeting which ultimatley depends on your *flex-direction*.
