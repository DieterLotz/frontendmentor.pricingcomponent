- Making a concerted effort to avoid over engineering the template portion
- Deeper understanding of CSS Selectors, pseudo classes and elements
- Deeper understanding of CSS Specificity 


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) - This site is perfect for anyone wanting to understand selectors in depth which helped me a lot.
- [Flexbox Cheat Sheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Flexbox can be tricky, especially when figuring out which axis the *align-items* and *justify-content* are targeting which ultimatley depends on your *flex-direction*.
